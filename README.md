## **📊 Tasks & Analysis**  

### **📞 Task 1: Call Center Trends Dashboard**  
Claire, a telecom manager, needed a **performance dashboard** to track call center efficiency. I designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with key call center metrics:  

✔ **Overall customer satisfaction score: 3.4/5** ⭐  
✔ **Total calls answered vs. abandoned** 📈  
✔ **Call volume by time of day** ⏳  
✔ **Average speed of answer (ASA): 67.52 sec** ⌛  
✔ **Agent performance quadrant** – comparing talk duration vs. calls answered 🎯  

📌 **Outcome:** The dashboard helped Claire monitor **agent productivity, customer wait times, and satisfaction trends** to optimize call center operations.

### **📢 Task 2: Customer Retention Dashboard**  
A few weeks later, the **Retention Manager** contacted me to develop a **dashboard for customer retention analysis**. Their key concerns were:  

✔ **Churn rate: 26.54% out of 7,043 customers** 📉  
✔ **Customer segmentation based on retention likelihood** 🔍  
✔ **Predicting customers at risk of leaving** 🚨
