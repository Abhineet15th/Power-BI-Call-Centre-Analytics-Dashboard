# **PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-Job-Simulation**  

An advanced **Power BI** project analyzing key business areas for a telecom client, including **Call Center Performance, Customer Retention, and Diversity & Inclusion**. This project provides **data-driven insights** and **interactive dashboards** to help management make informed decisions.  

---  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project is part of the **PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage**, where I developed **three Power BI dashboards** addressing critical business challenges:  

1️⃣ **Call Center Trends** – Analyzing call performance and agent efficiency  
2️⃣ **Customer Retention** – Identifying at-risk customers to reduce churn  
3️⃣ **Diversity & Inclusion** – Assessing gender balance and promotion trends  

By leveraging **Power BI’s data visualization capabilities**, this project delivers impactful insights for business decision-making.

## **📊 Tasks & Analysis**  

### 📞 [Task 1 - Call Centre Trends](Task%201%20-%20Call%20Centre%20Trends/)
  
Claire, a telecom manager, needed a **performance dashboard** to track call center efficiency. I designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with key call center metrics:  

✔ **Overall customer satisfaction score: 3.4/5** ⭐  
✔ **Total calls answered vs. abandoned** 📈  
✔ **Call volume by time of day** ⏳  
✔ **Average speed of answer (ASA): 67.52 sec** ⌛  
✔ **Agent performance quadrant** – comparing talk duration vs. calls answered 🎯  

📌 **Outcome:** The dashboard helped Claire monitor **agent productivity, customer wait times, and satisfaction trends** to optimize call center operations.

### 📢 [Task 2 - Customer Retention](Task%202%20-%20Customer%20Retention/)
  
A few weeks later, the **Retention Manager** contacted me to develop a **dashboard for customer retention analysis**. Their key concerns were:  

✔ **Churn rate: 26.54% out of 7,043 customers** 📉  
✔ **Customer segmentation based on retention likelihood** 🔍  
✔ **Predicting customers at risk of leaving** 🚨  
✔ **Tracking win-back success rates** 🔄  

📌 **Outcome:** By using **charts and DAX functions**, this dashboard enabled the Retention Team to **proactively identify at-risk customers** and improve retention strategies through **data-driven decision-making**.

### 👥 [Task 3 - Diversity & Inclusion](Task%203%20-%20Diversity%20&%20Inclusion/)
 
The **HR department** wanted to assess **gender balance and promotions** in leadership roles. I built a **Power BI dashboard** featuring:  

✔ **500 employees analyzed based on gender balance** 👨‍💼👩‍💼  
✔ **Number of male vs. female employees** 📊  
✔ **Promotion rates for men vs. women (FY21)** 📈  
✔ **Hiring gender distribution** 📋  
✔ **Employee turnover rates** 🔄  
✔ **Performance ratings by gender** ⭐  

📌 **Outcome:** The dashboard provided **clear insights into workforce diversity**, helping HR improve gender balance strategies at the executive level and **harmonize the workforce based on gender representation**.
